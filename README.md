# notes
Track notes and information regarding other /closed/ files -- such as movies (e.g; .mp4, .avi, etc)

In essense, I create a hidden subfolder (.gnotes) to tracks notes and modify the names for tracking usage/view counts.

I far prefer avoiding GUIs as much as possible -- no where near as productive as the command line.
